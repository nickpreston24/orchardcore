# Summary

There are a few libraries and bits of custom code I'm using for this project, that I think perfectly demonstrate not only how I code, but how flexible and fast I can solve a problem with what I'm given.

## What is CodeMechanic?

`CodeMechanic` is just my private repo of utility libraries for C# that I keep on GitHub.

It has helper methods that make C# a bit more fluid to work with, with without forcing dependencies on a project. E.g.,
making something like this incredibly simple and fast to write:

### Intent

1. Demonstrate my ability to seamlessly integrate 3rd party Nuget package into OrchardCore/GovBuilt.
2. Demonstrate how fast I can create a powerful, custom SQLite repo and inject it.   
3. Demonstrate nuget package competence and how it fits into any architcture.
4. Help me ease into the OC architecture with something familiar, while showing how fast I can learn and teach a new architecture.

#### Sample
